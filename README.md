# Data Science Salaries
This notebook was developed on Kaggle and copied to github. This notebook was made based on a dataset related to salaries of data scientists from around the world. My focus on this one was to explore the dataset and visualize the information we have, but I applied some machine learning algorithms to predict the salaries based on the information we had on the dataset.\
